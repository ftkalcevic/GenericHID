<h1>LED</h1>
<p>The LED control allows an LED (light emitting diode) to be connected to the 
HID Device.&nbsp; An LED 
appears as a HID output with an On/Off state.&nbsp; An LED can be connected to 
any I/O port.</p>
<p>An LED, with a current limiting resistor, can be wired directly to one of the 
microcontrollers IO pins.&nbsp; They can be connecting in two different ways: with the microcontroller 
sourcing current (source) or sinking it (sink).&nbsp; The two schematics show 
the differences...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ledsourcesink.png" width="204" height="162"></p>
<p>The first circuit shows the microcontroller pin, PD0, sourcing the current.&nbsp; 
The microcontroller pin switches between 0 volts (ground), and V<sub>CC</sub> (power supply 
voltage).&nbsp; To light the LED, the microcontroller provides V<sub>CC</sub>, 
and the current flow from the pin, through the LED and resistor, to ground.</p>
<p>In the second circuit, the LED will be lit when the microcontroller pin is 
set to 0 volts.&nbsp; The current run from the power supply, V<sub>CC</sub>, 
through the LED and resistor, back into microcontroller pin.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The only difference in the two methods is that sinking may turn on the LED 
momentarily when 
the microcontroller is being reset.&nbsp; Otherwise, as long as the microcontroller is 
told the method, it can make sure On means On.</p>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the LED.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Source">Source</h3>
<p>Defines whether the microcontroller sources or sinks the LED current.  This 
is described above.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the LED in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp;
