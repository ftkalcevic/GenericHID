<h1>LCD - Character based LCD Display</h1>
<p>Generic HID supports character based LCD modules that use the common HD44780U 
or equivalent driver chip (this is most 5x8 or 5x7 character based dot matrix 
displays).&nbsp; These displays come in sizes from 8x1, up to 20x4 and 40x2.&nbsp; 
There are 40x4 displays, which are basically two 40x2 displays, and currently, 
must be treated as two separate displays.</p>
<p>An LCD has a large number of pins that must be wired to the microcontroller.&nbsp; 
Any LCD pin can be wired to any microcontroller I/O pin.</p>
<p>LCDs can work in 4-bit mode or 8-bit mode.&nbsp; In 4-bit mode, only half the 
number of Data pins are required.&nbsp; LCD I/O pins D0..3 are not needed and 
should not be connected.&nbsp; Yes, the low numbered pins, 0..3 are the ones not 
needed.&nbsp; This saves 4 I/O pins, at the slight expense of speed, but it is 
generally not an issue.</p>
<p>LCDs are the only components in Generic HID that can share wires.&nbsp; The 
pins RS, R/W, D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7 can be wired to multiple LCD 
devices forming a data bus.&nbsp; The only pin that can't be shared is the E 
pin.&nbsp; E is the enable pin.&nbsp; It tells the LCD that data on the bus is 
for it.&nbsp; This way a large number of LCDs can be wired to Generic HID.</p>
<p>Here is an example of two LCDs wired in Generic HID...</p>

<p>Note that the LCD wires are sharing pins on the microcontroller, except for 
the E pins (red wires).&nbsp; They have their own I/O pins.&nbsp; Also, during 
testing I found one LCD display that did not work properly when sharing data 
lines.&nbsp; It had to be separated to make it work properly.</p>
<p>LCDs are pretty easy to wire up, but there a couple of gotchas.</p>
<p>First, most LCD displays run on 5 volts.&nbsp; A stock USB Key only provides 
3.3v.&nbsp; Unless the LCD works with 3.3v, the USB key will need to be modified 
to provide 5 volts.</p>
<p>Secondly, the backlight.&nbsp; Most LCDs have some form of backlighting, 
typically LED.&nbsp; These can draw large amounts of current, sometimes over 
250mA.&nbsp; A USB device, as described <a href="hardware.htm#current">here</a>, must be 
careful when drawing this much current.&nbsp; The LED back light must only come 
on after the USB connection has been successfully established.&nbsp; A method to
<a href="leds.htm#clr">limit the current must</a> also be used.&nbsp; The 
backlight current can also be reduced from what is recommended in an LCD 
datasheet.&nbsp; Backlights that are documented as requiring 250mA, usually run 
fine on 100mA.&nbsp; Experiment and see.</p>
<h3>Contrast</h3>
<p>The pictures above show the wiring that is required to connect an LCD to 
Generic HID.&nbsp; Apart from the power (V<sub>CC</sub> or V<sub>DD</sub>) and ground (GND or V<sub>SS</sub>) 
a standard LCD Character Module will have a pin used to set the contrast of the 
LCD display, V<sub>O</sub>, V<sub>LC</sub> or V<sub>LCD</sub>.&nbsp; This 
requires a potentiometer wired to this pin and, power and ground.&nbsp; A cheap 
10k trimmer potentiometer is adequate.&nbsp; Schematically, it should be 
connected as follows.</p>

<h3>USB Interface</h3>
<p>GenericHID implements a subset of the standard USB HID specification for 
character display modules.&nbsp; The following reports are implemented. This is 
included only if you wish to program your own device.&nbsp; This information can 
be retrieved from the HID descriptor reports.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the display.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Note- for an LCD display, this is fixed and cannot be changed.</p>

<h3 id="Rows">Rows</h3>
<p>The number of rows on the Display.</p>

<h3 id="Columns">Columns</h3>
<p>The number of columns on the Display.</p>

<h3 id="8Bit">8 Bit</h3>
<p>The number of data lines to connect to the LCD.  If true, 8 bits are used (all data lines D0-D7).  If false, only 4 bits, data lines D4-D7, are used.</p>

<h3 id="Row1Address">Row1Address</h3>
<p>The start address of row 1.</p>

<h3 id="Row2Address">Row2Address</h3>
<p>The start address of row 2.</p>

<h3 id="Row3Address">Row3Address</h3>
<p>The start address of row 3.</p>

<h3 id="Row4Address">Row4Address</h3>
<p>The start address of row 4.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the LED in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="power.htm">Power</a> for more information.</p>
<p> LCD displays use very little power to display the LCD text, typically 1-2mA.&nbsp; 
The LCD back light, however, are generally power hogs.</p>
