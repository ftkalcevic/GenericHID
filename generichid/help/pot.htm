<h1>Potentiometer</h1>
<p>The potentiometer control is used to connect analog inputs to the HID 
Device.&nbsp; Usually this will be a potentiometer, but other analog inputs can 
be connected.&nbsp; An analog input can only be connected to one of the 
microcontrollers ADC pins, PF0-PF7.</p>
<p>A potentiometer allows a variable voltage to be generated.&nbsp; They are 
typically an open resistor connected between the power supply and ground, with a 
wiper arm that touches the resistor.&nbsp; This creates a voltage divider 
circuit.&nbsp; When the wiper arm is in the middle, the output is half the 
voltage.&nbsp; At the top, it is full voltage.&nbsp; At the bottom, 0.&nbsp; Or, 
50%, 100%, and 0%.&nbsp; The schematic of the potentiometer is shown below.</p>

<p>The most common type of potentiometers are the rotary type.&nbsp; They can be 
used as they are to provide a volume control style input.&nbsp; Rotary 
potentiometers are usually found on the axis of joysticks.&nbsp; A two axis 
joystick will have two independent potentiometers.</p>
<p>There are also slide potentiometers that have a slider that moves up and 
down, rather than rotating.</p>
<p>Don't confuse a rotary/slide potentiometer with a linear/log potentiometer.&nbsp; 
Linear and Log refer to divider relationship with the wiper position.&nbsp; A 
Linear potentiometer will a linear relationship, eg 25% turn gives 25% voltage, 
75% gives 75%.&nbsp; A Log potentiometer gives a logarithmic response, eg 25% 
turn gives 5% output, 50% gives 10%, 75% give 50%.</p>
<p>Non-potentiometer devices, such as Hall Effect Joysticks, can be used as an 
analogue input, as long the voltage range stays within the range of the HID 
Device's voltage - 0v to 3.3v or 5v.</p>
<h2>ADC</h2>
<p>The ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter) of the microcontroller is used to 
convert the analogue signal to a digital number.&nbsp; Internally, the 
microcontroller measures the voltage and converts it to a 10 bit number (0 - 1023 (2<sup>10</sup>-1)).&nbsp; 
The <a href="#Bits">Bits</a> property can then be used to change the precision 
of the the number.&nbsp; 8 bit resolution (0-255) is generally precise enough. </p>
<p>The ADC converter samples the voltage about 8,000 times per second and 
averages 4 samples.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2><h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Bits">Bits</h3>
<p>ADC resolution the Potentiometer voltage is returned as.&nbsp; 8 bits returns 
a value from 0 - 255.&nbsp; 10 bits returns a value from 0 - 1023.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the potentiometer in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="power.htm">Power</a> for more information.</p>
<p> The current can be calculated by dividing the power supply voltage by the 
potentiometer resistance.&nbsp; V/R will give the current in amps, so it must be 
multiplied by 1000 to get mA.</p>
