<h1>AT90USBKey Demo board with WizBang wings</h1>
<p>This is a stripped <a href="at90usbkey.htm">AT90USBKey</a> demo board with 
the <a href="hardware.htm#wizbang">WizBang wings</a> installed.&nbsp; It has been 
modified according to the instructions in the section
<a href="hardware.htm#reclaiming">Reclaiming Pins</a> to free up more pins.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>The name of the USB HID device that will appear when listed by the host computer.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Device.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Be careful when setting this parameter.  The default setting of
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Multi-axis Controller</b> is fine and 
 should not need changing.  Setting it to a <b>Mouse</b> or <b>Pointer</b> device
 may confuse the operating system and the device will not operate as expected.
 Set it to
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Joystick</b> to make it appear as a game controller.</p>

<h3 id="Voltage">Voltage</h3>
<p>Is the microcontroller 5v or 3.3v? See <a href="hardware.htm">Hardware Design Decisions</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Power-Source">Power-Source</h3>
<p>Is the USB device powered via the USB Bus or does it use an external supply. See <a href="hardware.htm">Hardware Design Decisions</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Interval">Interval</h3>
<p>The interval, in milliseconds, at which the PC polls the HID device 
for updates.  The smaller the number, the faster the updates and more 
responsive the device is, at the cost of more CPU power.</p>

<h3 id="Serial-Debug">Serial-Debug</h3>
<p>Pins PD2/PD3 can be used as RXD/TXD pins for RS232 TTL Serial 
debug output (38400, 8, none, 1).  Setting the value above zero enables
debugging.  The higher the number the more debug (max 100).
</p>

<h3 id="HID-Debug">HID-Debug</h3>
<p>Enable debugging via the HID interface.  This isn't implemented yet.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p>The current usage of the microcontroller.  Used to estimate the USB power draw.  In milliamps (mA)</p>

<h3 id="UseStatusLEDs">Use Status LEDs</h3>
<p>Use the default AT90USBKey LEDs as indicators of the USB status.  There are 2 
<a href="tricolourled.htm">tri-colour LEDs</a>, LED1, LED2 on ports PD4/PD5, PD6/PD7.
These can be used show the status of the USB connection... </p>

<h3 id="SerialNo">SerialNo</h3><p>A unique serial number of the device. </p>
<h3 id="Timer1">Timer1</h3><p>Timer1 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PB5(OC1A), PB6(OC1B), PB7(OC1C) are derived from Timer 1.&nbsp; If a 
PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more 
information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer2">Timer2</h3><p>Timer2 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Two outputs, PB4(OC2A), 
and PD1(OC2B) are derived from Timer 2.&nbsp; If a PWM output is placed on one 
of these pins, they will all share the same base frequency and resolution.&nbsp; 
See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer3">Timer3</h3><p>Timer3 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PC6(OC3A), PC5(OC3B), and PC4(OC3C) are derived from Timer 3.&nbsp; If 
a PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more 
information.</p>
