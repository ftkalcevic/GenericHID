<h2 id=rungenerichid>Run Generic HID</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Launch the Generic HID application, this is generichid.exe in the directory 
that you unzipped the application.</p>
<p>If you get such-a-such error, you haven't installed libusb-win32</p>
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>Run generichid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should see an empty screen...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough1.png" width="640" height="467"></p>
<h2 id=select>Select the Microcontroller</h2>
<p>For this example we are going to use the Stock AT90USBKey.&nbsp; That's the 
first component in the toolbox.&nbsp; Click on the item and drag it onto the 
design surface.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough2.png" width="640" height="466"></p>
<h2 id=editproperties>Edit Properties</h2>
<p>Click on the Stock AT90USBKey that has just been placed on the design 
surface.&nbsp; This will select the item and display its properties in the 
property window.&nbsp; The Help window will show a description of the selected 
item.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough3.png" width="768" height="739"></p>
<h2 id=enableitems>Enable Stock Items</h2>
<p>In this demo, we are only going to enable the stock devices installed on the 
AT90USBKey.&nbsp; In the properties windows, make the following changes...</p>
<table cellpadding=5>

<h2 id=plugin>Plug in the Device</h2>
<p>Plug the device into the system.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Using Windows XP</h3>
<p>Generic HID has only been tested on Windows XP, but should work on newer 
Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>When you plug the device in, windows will detect the new device and try to 
install drivers.&nbsp; This is optional.&nbsp; The AT90USBKey comes 
preprogrammed as a mouse, a hid device and a flash drive.&nbsp; You may be 
prompted to install drivers, and then you can play with the device.&nbsp; The flash memory contains online 
manuals, data sheets and sample code for the at90usb1287 microcontroller. You 
can save this if you wish, but it is not needed for Generic HID, and most of the 
data is available on the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/">Atmel website</a>.</p>
<h3>Using Ubuntu 8.04</h3>
<p>Generic HID has only been tested using Ubuntu 8.04 (kernel 2.6.24-16), but 
should work with any linux with udev.</p>
<p>When the device is plugged in, linux will silently detect the device and load 
the necessary drivers.&nbsp; You can use the command <code>dmesg</code> to list 
the system logs and see what has happened.&nbsp; For example...</p>

Being
a secure operating system, linux will not let just any application directly 
access a USB device.&nbsp; Permissions must be set so Generic HID can access the 
device while it is a HID device, and when it is program mode.&nbsp; See this
<a href="linuxpermissions.htm">section</a> for details on how to set up 
permissions.</p>
<h2 id=programming>Programming</h2>
<p>In Generic HID, select the Microcontroller | Program... menu option.&nbsp; 
The programming window will appear...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough4.png" width="202" height="237"></p>
<p>Note that all the lights are red and the buttons are disabled.&nbsp; The 
AT90USBKey is running in Mouse/HID/Flash Drive mode and the Generic HID software 
cannot recognise it.&nbsp; For it to be recognised, it needs to either be 
programmed as a Generic HID, or be running in&nbsp; bootloader mode.</p>
<p>Normally bootloader mode can be entered just by pressing the &quot;Start 
Bootloader&quot; button.&nbsp; Because this is the first time we are going to program 
the device, we need to enter bootloader manually by using the buttons on the 
board...</p>
<ol>
	<li>Press and hold the HWB button</li>
	<li>Press and release the RST button</li>
	<li>Release the HWB button</li>
</ol>
<p>The device should now enter bootloader mode.&nbsp; This sequence can be used 
anytime the device appears unresponsive.</p>
<p>The program window should now detect the device...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough5.png" width="202" height="237"></p>
<p>Press the Program button.&nbsp; A progress bar will show the programmer in 
action.</p>
<p>When the programming is complete press the &quot;Restart Device&quot; button.&nbsp; Now 
the Generic HID device should be detected.&nbsp; The Program dialog box will now 
identify the device.&nbsp; If it doesn't, press the RST button on the board, or 
unplug the device and plug it in again.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough6.png" width="202" height="237"></p>
<h2 id=test>Test the Device</h2>
<p>Close the Program dialog box.&nbsp; Then select the Test panel.&nbsp; If the 
Generic HID device is connected, it will automatically appear...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="walkthrough7.png" width="701" height="506"></p>
<p>The Test panel shows the parts on AT90USBKey that appear as a HID items...</p>

		<td>DFU</td>
		<td>This is the way the bootloader is started.&nbsp; Nothing can be done 
		with this.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Temperature</td>
		<td>There is a thermistor on the AT90USBKey - a resistor that changes
