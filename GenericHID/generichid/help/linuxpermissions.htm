<h1>Linux Permissions</h1>
				<p>
				Note - this information applies to Ubuntu 
					10.04 and 12.04, and may or may not work for other versions.
				</p>
				<p>
				When you insert a USB device, by default, the device is owned by <a class="code">root</a>.
				A quick and dirty work-around is to run <b>GenericHID</b> as <a class="code">root</a> but
				that will only allow the device to be built, and not run by the 
				target application.
				</p>
				<p>
				The correct solution is to create a udev rules file.  A file is create in /etc/udev/rules.d which 
				tells udev (the dynamic device management system) what to do when the device is inserted.  
				These files are flexible, allowing other applications to be 
				launched, but we
				only need to set permissions.
				</p>
<p>
				Permissions must be set for both the Generic HID device, and the 
				DFU device (the device that appears when in programming mode).</p>
				<p>Here is an example of a udev rules file.  In my <a class="code">/etc/udev/rules.d/</a> folder I have created the 
				file <a class="code">99-hid.rules</a>.  The name of the file is not important, as long as it has the extension <a class="code">.rules</a>.
				</p>
				<p>For Ubuntu 10.04...</p>
				<blockquote class="code">
					# Generic HID device<br>
					SYSFS{idProduct}=="04d9",  SYSFS{idVendor}=="1c40", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"<br>
					# Atmel DFU file for at90usb1286, at90usb1287<br>
					SYSFS{idProduct}=="2ffb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"<br>
					<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p>For Ubuntu 12.04...</p>
				<blockquote class="code">
					# Generic HID device<br>
					ATTRS{idProduct}=="04d9",  ATTRS{idVendor}=="1c40", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"<br>
					# Atmel DFU file for at90usb1286, at90usb1287<br>
					ATTRS{idProduct}=="2ffb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"<br>
					<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
				In my file, each data line has 4 parts.  The first two specify the PID and VID of the USB device
				that this line applies to.  The last 2 parts refer to the commands to run when a device is found.
				In this case, we set the permissions on the device to 0660 (owner=read/write, group=read/write), and
				we set the group of the device to <a class="code">plugdev</a>.
				</p>
				<p>The lines beginning with # are comments.</p>
				<p>For this file to work, there must also be a group on the system called <a class="code">plugdev</a>, and 
				the user account that runs Generic HID and the application that 
				uses the HID device must belong to this group.  This can be done with the commands...
				</p>
				<blockquote class="code">
					sudo addgroup plugdev<br>
					sudo addgroup myloginname plugdev
				</blockquote>
				<p>The rules file will take effect next time the device is plugged in.</p>
				<p>There is more information about the rules file in <b>udev(7)</b> 
				man page. </p>
