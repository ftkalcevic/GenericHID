<h1>Teensy++ 2.0 USB Development Board</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy++ 2.0 USB Development Board</a> 
is an ultra compact, inexpensive, USB development
board built using the at90usb1286.&nbsp; This is a purpose built breakout board
so it doesn't have any of the problems a stock at90usbkey will have - the pins are laid out
on a standard 0.1" pitch, and there are no other "accessories" to tie up pins. (except for the 
LED on pin PD6)
</p>
<p>
The board is built and sold by <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/">PJRC</a>.

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>The name of the USB HID device that will appear when listed by the host computer.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Device.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Be careful when setting this parameter.  The default setting of
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Multi-axis Controller</b> is fine and 
 should not need changing.  Setting it to a <b>Mouse</b> or <b>Pointer</b> device
 may confuse the operating system and the device will not operate as expected.
 Set it to
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Joystick</b> to make it appear as a game controller.</p>

<h3 id="Voltage">Voltage</h3>
<p>Teensy++ 2.0 is a 5v board.</p>

<h3 id="Power-Source">Power-Source</h3>
<p>Teensy++ 2.0 is bus powered.</p>

<h3 id="Interval">Interval</h3>
<p>The interval, in milliseconds, at which the PC polls the HID device 
for updates.  The smaller the number, the faster the updates and more 
responsive the device is, at the cost of more CPU power.</p>

<h3 id="Serial-Debug">Serial-Debug</h3>
<p>Pins PD2/PD3 can be used as RXD/TXD pins for RS232 TTL Serial 
debug output (38400, 8, none, 1).  This greatly slows down the device
and generally shouldn't be used.
</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p>The current usage of the microcontroller.  Used to estimate the USB power draw.  In milliamps (mA)</p>

<h3 id="UseStatusLEDs">Use Status LEDs</h3>
<p>A status LED is connected to port PD6 on the Teensy++ 2.0 board.&nbsp; It can be used to show the status of the USB connection... </p>

<h3 id="SerialNo">SerialNo</h3><p>A unique serial number of the device. </p>
<h3 id="Timer1">Timer1</h3><p>Timer1 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PB5(OC1A), PB6(OC1B), PB7(OC1C) are derived from Timer 1.&nbsp; If a 
PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more 
information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer2">Timer2</h3><p>Timer2 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Two outputs, PB4(OC2A), 
and PD1(OC2B) are derived from Timer 2.&nbsp; If a PWM output is placed on one 
of these pins, they will all share the same base frequency and resolution.&nbsp; 
See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer3">Timer3</h3><p>Timer3 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PC6(OC3A), PC5(OC3B), and PC4(OC3C) are derived from Timer 3.&nbsp; If 
a PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more
