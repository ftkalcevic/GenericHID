<h1>Trouble Shooting</h1>
<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td>Symptom</td>
		<td>Things to try</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Can't get into programming mode</td>
		<td>Try the hardware buttons...<ul>
			<li>Press and hold the HWB button</li>
			<li>Press and release the RST button</li>
			<li>Release the HWB button</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This should always get into the bootloader firmware.&nbsp; The 
		bootloader can't be erased unless a hardware programmer erases it.</p>
		<p>Windows XP can get upset with the device jumping from mode to mode.&nbsp; 
		It may just be that device isn't being recognised.&nbsp; Try unplugging 
		it and then plugging it in again.&nbsp; Try a reboot if that doesn't 
		work.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Windows XP keeps blue screening</td>
		<td>I've seen this a couple of times when two identical devices are 
		plugged in.&nbsp; I even found a knowledge base article about it, saying 
		it will happen if 2 identical devices are connected, but since then I 
		haven't been able to reproduce the problem.&nbsp; Maybe it was a Windows 
		Update.&nbsp; Let me know if it happens to you.&nbsp; The work around is 
		to give the devices different serial numbers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Device doesn't appear in Linux, or Windows reports &quot;Unrecognised 
		device&quot;.</td>
		<td>If this occurs after programming the device, there may be bugs in 
		the firmware.&nbsp; Contact the developer at
		<a href="http://www.franksworkshop.com.au">www.franksworkshop.com.au</a>.<p>
		If this happens and you can't get back into boot loader mode, follow the 
		following instructions...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Disconnect the device.</li>
			<li>With one hand, press and hold the RST button.</li>
			<li>With the other hand, press and hold the HWB button.</li>
			<li>With another hand, connect the device to a different USB port 
			than was used previously.</li>
			<li>Release the RST button.</li>
			<li>Release the HWB button.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When an invalid USB device is connected to windows, the operating 
		system can get upset and will not allow you to reuse the port.&nbsp; 
		Using the standard HWB/RST method won't work because windows still 
		thinks the unrecognised device is plugged in.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>After the device is programmed, it doesn't appear in linux or 
		windows.</td>
		<td>If the power requirements for the device are too high for the USB 
		Port/HUB, the device will just be ignored without any error messages.&nbsp; 
		For a device that uses a lot of power, make sure you use a powered USB 
		hub, and the power is connected.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Generic HID can't find the device in programming or regular mode.</td>
		<td>The libusb drivers can be finicky.&nbsp; Try rebooting.&nbsp; Try 
		reinstalling the libusb-win32 filter driver.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Other USB devices fail under Windows.</td>
		<td>The libusb-win32 filter driver can effect other devices.&nbsp; After 
		you have finished building your GenericHID device, unistall the 
		libusb-win32 filter drivers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>In the programming dialog, GenericHID complains with the message 
		&quot;More than one GenericHID device (GenericHID or AT90USB128 in DFU mode) 
		found in the system. This may be a USB driver glitch; in this case you 
		can ignore the message. If there are multiple devices plugged in, you 
		may program the wrong one.&quot;</td>
		<td>To be able to program the device correctly, only one GenericHID 
		device must be present.&nbsp; This message will be displayed when more 
		than one GenericHID devices, or AT90USB1287 devices in programming mode 
		are detected.<p>Note that this message can be incorrectly displayed 
		because of driver conflicts between libusb and other device drivers.&nbsp; 
		It is left to the user to ensure the correct device is plugged in.</td>
