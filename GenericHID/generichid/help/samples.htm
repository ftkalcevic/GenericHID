<h2>CNC Pendant 1</h2>
<p>This is my first CNC pendant, designed for Mach3.&nbsp; It has many 
unnecessary controls, but I added them so I can build and test Generic HID.&nbsp; 
It has both a jog dial and axis joysticks.&nbsp; When I decide which one I like, 
my next pendant will have them.&nbsp; I have also yet to update my mach3 
drivers, so I'm using this with my lathe, <a href="http://www.linuxcnc.org/">
EMC2</a> and <a href="http://www.franksworkshop.com.au/EMC/hidcomp/hidcomp.htm">
hidcomp</a>.</p>
