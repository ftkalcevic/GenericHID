<h1>Stock AT90USBKey Demo Board</h1>
<p>This is a stock <a href="at90usbkey.htm">AT90USBKey</a> demo board without any modifications.&nbsp; This 
seriously limits the number of free I/O pins available.&nbsp; See the section,
<a href="hardware.htm#reclaiming">Reclaiming Pins</a>, for information on how to 
recover some pins.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>The name of the USB HID device that will appear when listed by the host computer.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Device.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Be careful when setting this parameter.  The default setting of
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Multi-axis Controller</b> is fine and 
 should not need changing.  Setting it to a <b>Mouse</b> or <b>Pointer</b> device
 may confuse the operating system and the device will not operate as expected.
 Set it to
 <b>Generic Desktop Controls:Joystick</b> to make it appear as a game controller.</p>

<h3 id="Voltage">Voltage</h3>
<p>Is the microcontroller 5v or 3.3v? See <a href="hardware.htm">Hardware Design Decisions</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Power-Source">Power-Source</h3>
<p>Is the USB device powered via the USB Bus or does it use an external supply. See <a href="hardware.htm">Hardware Design Decisions</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Interval">Interval</h3>
<p>The interval, in milliseconds, at which the PC polls the HID device 
for updates.  The smaller the number, the faster the updates and more 
responsive the device is, at the cost of more CPU power.</p>

<h3 id="Serial-Debug">Serial-Debug</h3>
<p>Pins PD2/PD3 can be used as RXD/TXD pins for RS232 TTL Serial 
debug output (38400, 8, none, 1).  This greatly slows down the device
and generally shouldn't be used.
</p>

<h3 id="HID-Debug">HID-Debug</h3>
<p>Enable debugging via the HID interface.  This isn't implemented yet.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p>The current usage of the microcontroller.  Used to estimate the USB power draw.  In milliamps (mA)</p>

<h3 id="UseStatusLEDs">Use Status LEDs</h3>
<p>Use the default AT90USBKey LEDs as indicators of the USB status.  There are 2 
<a href="tricolourled.htm">tri-colour LEDs</a>, LED1, LED2 on ports PD4/PD5, PD6/PD7.
These can be used show the status of the USB connection... </p>
<table cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
		<td>Orange</td>
		<td>Startup</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Red</td>
		<td>Establishing Connection</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>Connected and Ready</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>This settings works in combination with <a href="#UseLEDs">Use LEDs</a>.  Any spare LEDs are used as the indicator.</p>

<h3 id="UseLEDs">Use LEDs</h3>
<p>Use the stock AT90USBKey LEDs as device output LEDs.  The LED will automatically
appear as an output with 4 values - </p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>off</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>green</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>orange</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>red</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
<a href="#UseStatusLEDs">Use Status LEDs</a> must be set to <b>LED1</b>, <b>LED2</b>, or 
<b>None</b>.</p>

<h3 id="UseVoltageMonitor">Use Voltage Monitor</h3>
<p>Use the stock AT90USBKey Voltage Monitor as an analog input.  The device's 
voltage will appear as an 8-bit analog input 
(values from 0-255).&nbsp; The default setting will show about 100, 3.3v.&nbsp; 
This value won't change.</p>

<h3 id="UseTemperatureSensor">Use Temperature Sensor</h3>
<p>Use the stock AT90USBKey Temperature Sensor as an analog input.  The 
<a href="at90usbkey.htm#thermistor">negative 
temperature coefficient thermistor</a>, R29, will appear as an 8-bit analog input 
(values from 0-255). As the temperature rises, the value will go down.  You can test this by 
placing a finger on it and watching the output go down (or up if it is already 
hot).</p>

<h3 id="UseJoystick">Use Joystick</h3><p>Enabling this option will make the on board &quot;<a href="at90usbkey.htm#Joystick">joystick</a>&quot; 
appear as a hat switch and button in the USB HID Device.</p>
<h3 id="UseHWB">Use HWB</h3><p>Enabling this option will make the
<a href="at90usbkey.htm#hwb">HWB</a> button appear as a input button on the USB 
HID Device.</p>
<h3 id="SerialNo">SerialNo</h3><p>A unique serial number of the device. </p>
<h3 id="Timer1">Timer1</h3><p>Timer1 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PB5(OC1A), PB6(OC1B), PB7(OC1C) are derived from Timer 1.&nbsp; If a 
PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more 
information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer2">Timer2</h3><p>Timer2 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Two outputs, PB4(OC2A), 
and PD1(OC2B) are derived from Timer 2.&nbsp; If a PWM output is placed on one 
of these pins, they will all share the same base frequency and resolution.&nbsp; 
See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="Timer3">Timer3</h3><p>Timer3 configuration.  The Generic HID device
<a href="pwm.htm">PWM</a> outputs use shared timer resources.&nbsp; Three 
outputs, PC6(OC3A), PC5(OC3B), and PC4(OC3C) are derived from Timer 3.&nbsp; If 
a PWM output is placed on one of these pins, they will all share the same base 
frequency and resolution.&nbsp; See <a href="timers.htm">Timers</a> for more 
information.</p>
